Project: IT Help Desk Analysis using SQLite and Python!!

This dataset was gotten from fp20analytics.com monthly Analytics challenges(August 2023 version)

The IT Help Desk Analysis project aims to provide insights into the efficiency of IT support processes and customer satisfaction. The project utilizes two datasets: the "data" dataset containing information about IT help desk tickets and the "agents" dataset containing details about the support agents. These datasets are interconnected through the "Agent ID" column. By analyzing the data, stakeholders aim to optimize support operations, enhance customer experience, and identify areas for improvement.

# Some Recommendations based on the dataset-

Regular Data Analysis:
Continuously monitor key performance indicators such as resolution time, satisfaction rate, and ticket trends. Regular data analysis can help identify emerging patterns and address potential issues before they escalate.

Agent Performance Improvement:
Agents like Aurelio Tanori and Jesus Contreras have consistently resolved the highest number of issues with a good average satisfaction rate. It might be beneficial to study their practices and approaches to customer service and share these best practices with other agents.

Satisfaction Rate Analysis:
Agents' satisfaction rates have shown a positive trend over the years. This suggests that the customer service strategies implemented are effective. However, consistent monitoring and periodic training should be provided to maintain and improve customer satisfaction levels.

Ticket Trends Over the Years:
The number of tickets raised has increased significantly over the years. To manage this increase, it's recommended to streamline and automate processes wherever possible. This could involve implementing self-help resources for common issues to reduce the load on agents.

Agent Training and Development:
Based on the identified top agents, consider implementing mentorship programs where experienced agents can provide guidance to newer agents. Additionally, regular training sessions could address common issues and customer service strategies.

Overall, by implementing these recommendations, the IT Help Desk can enhance customer satisfaction, streamline operations, and provide better support to employees, resulting in a more efficient and effective service.
